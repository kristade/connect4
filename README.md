# connect4
Hello there and welcome to my version of connect4.<br/><br/>
As said before, I have created my own version of Connect4. I do not own the copyrights to the original Connect 4. The rules and directions are closely similar to the original. The red and blue chips will be replace with 'X' and 'O' ascii characters. The player will have two game options. Per usual the player to connect four of their ascii characters in a row horizonally, vertically, and/or diagonally first wins.<br /><br/>
Below I have provided a link to demonstrate how the game is operated.<br/>
