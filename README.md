# Introduction
I created my own version of Connect4. I do not own the copyrights to the original Connect 4. The rules and direction are closely similar ro the original. The red and blue chips will be replace with 'X' and 'O' ascii characters. The player will have two game options. They can either play against another player or play against the computer. Player One will always be 'X', and Player Two and Computer will be 'O'.<br />
